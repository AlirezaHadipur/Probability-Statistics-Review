# Probability and Statistics Review Project

## Introduction
This project serves as a review and practical application of theoretical concepts in probability and statistics. Aspiring data analysts often encounter these fundamental principles, making it essential to reinforce understanding through hands-on experience.

## Background
Motivated by a passion for data analysis, I embarked on a journey to solidify my knowledge of statistics and probability. After completing a course on theoretical concepts from [Maktabkhoone](https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B3%DB%8C-mk627/), I recognized the need to apply these principles in real-world scenarios using Python.

## Tools Used
Throughout this project, I used different libraries in Python to speed up my work. In one glance the tools are:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- VS Code
- Git and GitHub
- Microsoft Copilot

## Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I gained insights into various aspects of data analysis, using my own examples to bring theoretical concepts closer to the real world. The projects I did include:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](/Step1_Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
- [Marginal distributions](/Step2_Marginal%20Distribution/Marginal_Distribution.ipynb)
- [Understanding different distributions such as normal, uniform, binomial, and more](/Step3_Distributions/Distributions.ipynb)
- [Statistical testing techniques including hypothesis testing like Fisher exact test, t-test](/Step4_Statisicsl_Testing/Statistics_Testing.ipynb)


## Conclusion
Engaging in this project has reinforced the importance of statistical and probabilistic knowledge in the field of data analysis. By applying theoretical concepts in practical scenarios, I have enhanced my skills and confidence as a data analyst. I look forward to leveraging this experience to tackle complex data challenges effectively.
